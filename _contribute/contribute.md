Laptop Wiki is maintained by enthusiasts from laptop communities around the globe. This section details how you can be a part of it too.

The wiki is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com){:target="_blank"}. It uses a [fork](https://github.com/pdmosses/just-the-docs/tree/combination-rec-nav){:target="_blank"} from [PDMosses](https://pdmosses.github.io){:target="_blank"} of the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/){:target="_blank"} theme.
