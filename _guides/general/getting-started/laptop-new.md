# First Time Checklist

## The ultimate first time checklist guide to help you getting started with your new laptop!
- [ ] Check box for obvious shipping damage
- [ ] Check laptop for dents and scratches
- [ ] Check packaging (confirm new model)
- [ ] Check power brick and cord damage
- [ ] Check for cracks, fractures or impact marks
- [ ] Open and close lid (check hinges) (when setting up windows, don’t connect to wifi, therefore you won’t have to deal with unnecessary microsoft services)
- [ ] Verify actual specs are what you bought (hwinfo and model number)
- [ ] Check all keyboard keys multiple hits (enter key)
- [ ] Check for [dead pixels](https://lcdtech.info/en/tests/dead.pixel.htm) (black and white screen tests), Perform [Monitor Tests](https://arnowelzel.de/en/tools/monitor-test)
- [ ] Check all ports working (check snugness and fit)
- [ ] Check profiles and fan speeds (noise)
- [ ] Check RGB across diff profiles (dark room and well lit)
- [ ] Check for backlight bleed
- [ ] Check trackpad for motion and click feel
- [ ] Check different resolutions
- [ ] Take [system image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9BGn4MivJw) “out of the box”
- [ ] Remove bloatware (McAfee, etc.)
- [ ] Update Vantage software (if available) or Legion Toolkit (*Highly recommended* due to lower resource usage)
- [ ] Update bios (check Discord for best current version). However if you don’t have any issue with it, don’t. Don’t fix it if it ain’t broken. [First time users, don’t update Bios]
- [ ] Update NVIDIA/AMD DGPU driver (check Discord for best current version)
- [ ] Connect to wifi and run Windows update
- [ ] Charge battery and confirm 100% as start point
- [ ] Review Discord/Reddit for any new issues experienced by new owners
- [ ] Install Benchmarking and Hardware info tools
- [ ] Download flight sim and games
- [ ] Confirm benchmarks measure up to other users of same model (Cinebench for CPU, aida64 + heaven for combined load stress test, 3Dmark timespy/firestrike for an overall benchmark, shadow of the tomb raider for a non-synthetic benchmark)

## Benchmarks you can run on your Laptop to verify and compare performances

- TimeSpy (CPU, GPU and global performances scores)
- Cinebench R23 (multi-core and single-core CPU performances)
- CrystalDiskMark (config set to SSD) for read/write SSD performances
- Built-in benchmark of the game SOTTR (free demo) with settings set to HIGHEST, once at native resolution and once at 1080p
- No benchmark specific to RAM, as it is part of the global CPU performance
